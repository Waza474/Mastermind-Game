                  Mastermind : Super City Police Force
+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x
 
  Welcome Captain, 

  Mastermind and his super villain team "BAM" are back at it again, they
  have planted bombs all over the city and they need to be defused.

  Before we can get anywhere, you must sign into the system first:
	
  a) Type in your name and press Enter.
  b) Select which villain you will pursue: 
  	[1] Blast Boy = standard: 4 columns x 10 rows 
 	[2] Amateur Atom = tricky: 5 columns x 12 rows - AND DUPLICATES! 
 	[3] Mastermind = hard: 6 columns x 14 rows
 
  Once you have logged in, you are ready to save the city.
 
  In order to save Super City, you need to diffuse the many bombs planted
  by the BAM crew, to do so you type in a series of numbers and press
  ENTER to check it against the super villain's code. Think carefully,
  our defusal system only allows a few attempts before it's too late.

  The defusal system is set up to help, each time you enter a code, clues
  will show if you have guessed any number correctly (o) or guessed
  correctly but is in the wrong place (?). The length of the secret code
  will always be showed, so will your previous attempts.

  At any time whilst defusing, you may type these:
  
  [C] For an extra clue on the secret code (3 per game). 
  [H] To display this help screen again. 
  [Q] To quit/close the game 
  [X] To skip this bomb and hand it over to another captain 
	(This will erase any win streak). 
  [S] To save the current progress of the Game. 
  [L] To load a save state.

  After 5 successful defuses, the option to move onto the next villain 
  will appear.
  Although, if you fail 5 in a row, you will be automatically demoted
  to the previous villain.

  We wish you the best of luck captain, save Super City...
